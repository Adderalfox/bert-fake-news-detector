# 📰 BERT Fake News Detector

This project fine-tunes a pre-trained BERT model to detect fake news articles with high accuracy. It includes a complete deep learning pipeline — from raw data preprocessing to training, evaluation, and prediction — all implemented using PyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers.

## 🔍 What You'll Find Here
- ✅ Clean dataset processing pipeline (Fake vs True news)
- 🤖 Fine-tuned `BertForSequenceClassification` model
- 📊 Evaluation metrics and training visualizations
- 🛠️ Modular scripts for training and real-time prediction
- 🚀 Ready-to-use project structure for NLP tasks

## 📂 Use Cases
This can be extended to:
- Social media misinformation detection
- News curation and filtering platforms
- Any binary classification NLP problem
